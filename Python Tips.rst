Python & Coding
================

Main Points
++++++++++++

Variables
//////////
- Use full Names - don't abbreviate

Functions
/////////
- Small and descriptive names
- Should only do 1 thing, and 1 thing well
  * i.e. functions should not have `and`s, e.g. `filter_and_save(df)`
  * What is returned should be logical
- Order of parameters is important
  * The most important variable should be first
- parameterise the function as much as possible
